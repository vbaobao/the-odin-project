            <li>Copy your original code into a new file so you don’t lose it.</li>
            <li>For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.</li>
            <li>Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)</li>
            <li>Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.</li>
            <li>Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.</li>
            <li>You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.</li>
            <li>Don’t forget to go back and add your new version to the original Rock Paper Scissors Project!</li>
